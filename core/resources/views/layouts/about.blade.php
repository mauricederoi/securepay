    	Payonhold is a payment option that allows individuals and corporate organizations to pay for goods and services without worrying about losing their money as they are in complete control of their transactions. Payonhold works in a very simple yet effective way  - The buyer is able to create a transaction on the platform and keep track of his/her payment until goods or services are delivered as agreed. After a successful delivery, the buyer goes to their transaction page and click the 'Release' botton and payments is instantly released to the seller and ready for withdrawals.<br></b> <br>In cases where goods/services are not delivered as agreed, the buyer simple go to their transaction page and 'Report' that transaction which automatically sends a chat message to Payonhold as well as the seller. The buyer and the seller can settle disputes via our inbuilt chat system and come to a resolution and close the deal.</b><br></b><br>At Payonhold, sellers are also protected, as their payments are held by the platform and ready to be released when they deliver. The payonhold platform is fully automated and holds fund until both buyer meets their terms. It is the best way a seller is guaranteed of payments while a buyer is also guaranteed that goods/services will be delivered.</b>
